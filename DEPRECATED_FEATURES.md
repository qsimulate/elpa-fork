## DEPRECATED FEATURES OF *ELPA* ##

This file contains a list of features, which have been replaced by other options.
Thus these features are considered as deprecated, and will be removed at some point
in the (near) future from the *ELPA* library.

### A) Deprecated interfaces:###

With the release of ELPA 2017.05.001 a new, more general API for the library has
been published. All new features of ELPA will only be accessible via this new interface.
For ease of transiiton, the old API as defined in release ELPA 2016.11.001 has been frozen in
and will be still supported for some time, albeit without any new features. This old API has been
deprecated in release ELPA 2019.11.001 and has been removed.



### B) Runtime options ###
At the moment no runtime options are deprecated. However, future options will only be available via the new
interface
